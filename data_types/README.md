# Data Types

A data type is a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it.

## Primitive Built-in Tyoes

These are the most commonly used data types in any ALB program.

#### Numeric Data Types

- `:int`: stands for _integer_ (signed and in base 10 by default). Can hold any integer numeric value or set of arithmetic operations with an integer as result. Values corresponding to this data type typically have a width of 4 bytes, and can hold numbers in a range between -2147483648 and 2147483647. Examples: `321`, `2`, `613731`.

- `:float`: stands for _floating-point number_. Can hold any floating-point numeric value or set of arithmetic operations with a floating-point number as result. Values corresponding to this data type typically have a width of 4 bytes, and can hold a range of numbers between +/- 3.4e +/- 38 (~7 digits).
